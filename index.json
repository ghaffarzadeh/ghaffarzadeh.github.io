The article introduces a novel aggregative game model where heterogeneous EVs simultaneously plan their parking lot as their destination (usually accompanied by battery charging) and the route to the destination. The factors such as traveling time, variable costs of congestion and electricity demand, and tolling which is imposed to satisfy coupling constraints such as road capacity and station power capacity are considered in the model. Since the users are selfish and do not reveal their objectives and personal constraints, the proposed scheme is a privacy preserving decentralized algorithm with a traffic coordinator and multiple stationâ€™ coordinators. The solution concept is the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) point of the game model.","tags":["Game Theory","Variational Inequalities","Decentralized Algorithm","Electric Vehicles","Nash Equilibrium","Monotone Games"],"title":"Decentralized Equilibrium Seeking of Joint Routing and Destination Planning of Electric Vehicles: A Constrained Aggregative Game Approach","type":"publication"}]
